## 1. Executive Summary

GymFlow is a production-grade, mobile-first fitness tracking and workout planning application. It enables users to define weekly gym routines, track workout execution, monitor body metrics, set and pursue fitness goals, and receive AI-assisted workout optimization — all within a secure, offline-capable Progressive Web App.

## 2. Product Vision

**For** health-conscious individuals who work out regularly,  
**GymFlow** is a fitness platform  
**that** replaces paper logs and fragmented tracking apps with a single intelligent system for planning, executing, and analyzing workouts.

### Guiding Principles

| Principle             | Meaning                                                         |

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001 — Performance

| Metric                         | Target                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |

## 6. Feature Definitions

### Feature: Onboarding (FR-001)

**Purpose:** Collect minimum user data to personalise calculations and UI.

**Inputs:** Name, date of birth, biological sex, height (cm), current weight, fitness goal type, activity level, experience level.

**Outputs:** Persisted `User` + `UserProfile` record; redirect to dashboard.

**DB Dependencies:** `User`, `UserProfile`

**Edge Cases:**

- User navigates away mid-onboarding — partial data must not persist.
- Future date of birth — validated server-side (age 13–120).
- Height/weight outside physiological range — reject with validation error.
- OAuth user — profile pre-filled from OAuth provider.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: Onboarding completable in < 3 minutes.
- AC2: Invalid data shows inline errors without page reload.
- AC3: Dashboard renders with personalised data after onboarding.

**Tests:**

- Unit: `validateOnboardingInput()` rejects invalid DOB, height, weight.
- Integration: POST `/api/profile/onboard` persists correct data.
- E2E: Full onboarding flow via Playwright.

---

### Feature: Workout Execution (FR-008)

**Purpose:** Distraction-free mode for executing a planned workout with real-time set logging.

**Inputs:** Active routine day exercises, "Start Workout" action.

**Outputs:** Completed `WorkoutSession` with `ExerciseLog` and `SetLog` records.

**DB Dependencies:** `WorkoutSession`, `ExerciseLog`, `SetLog`, `RoutineDay`, `RoutineDayExercise`

**Edge Cases:**

- App closed mid-workout — session auto-saved as draft; user can resume.
- User logs 0 sets — session marked abandoned.
- Network lost during workout — offline queue handles set writes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: "Start Workout" creates `WorkoutSession` immediately.
- AC2: Each set completion writes `SetLog` within 500 ms (online) or queues offline.
- AC3: Finishing marks session `status: COMPLETED`.
- AC4: Previous performance visible for every exercise.

**Tests:**

- Unit: `computeWorkoutVolume()`, `computeFrequency()`.
- Integration: POST `/api/sessions`, PATCH `/api/sessions/:id`.
- E2E: Start → log sets → finish.

---

### Feature: Statistics (FR-011)

**Purpose:** Meaningful progress data across time horizons.

**Inputs:** `userId`, `period` (week | month | year), `referenceDate`.

**Outputs:** `{ totalVolume, workoutCount, totalDuration, muscleGroupBreakdown, personalRecords }`.

**Edge Cases:**

- No data for period — return zeroed stats, not error.
- Weight unit must be respected.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: Stats render within 500 ms for 1 year of data.
- AC2: Volume shown in user's preferred weight unit.

**Tests:**

- Unit: `aggregateWeeklyStats()`, `findPersonalRecords()`.
- Integration: GET `/api/stats?period=week`.

---

### Feature: Goal System (FR-013)

**Purpose:** Focused, measurable motivation aligned to the user's fitness objective.

**Inputs:** Goal type, target value, target date.

**Outputs:** `Goal` record; progress bar data on dashboard.

**Edge Cases:**

- Second active goal attempt — reject; offer to archive current.
- Target date passes without completion — mark `EXPIRED`.
- Weight-loss goal with no weight logs — progress indeterminate; prompt to log.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: Only one `status: ACTIVE` goal per user (DB constraint + service check).
- AC2: Progress bar computed from authoritative data, not AI.
- AC3: Goal completion triggers celebration animation and prompt.

**Tests:**

- Unit: `computeGoalProgress()` for each goal type.
- Integration: POST `/api/goals` rejects second active goal.
- E2E: Set goal → achieve → celebrate → set new goal.

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A1  | The exercise API (ExerciseDB or WGER) provides sufficient free-tier data to seed the library.    |
| A2  | AI calls are made via Vercel AI SDK using OpenAI GPT-4o or Google Gemini with structured output. |
| A3  | Push notifications use the Web Push API; no native SDK required for v1.                          |
| A4  | Weight unit is a user preference; the database always stores values in kg.                       |
| A5  | All time is stored in UTC; display converted to user's local timezone client-side.               |
| A6  | Mifflin-St Jeor equation used for BMR; activity factors defined as named constants.              |
| A7  | "Biological sex" collected for BMR accuracy, not for identity; optional and privacy-sensitive.   |
| A8  | Offline sync conflicts resolved with last-write-wins using server timestamps.                    |
